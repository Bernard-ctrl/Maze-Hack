# Mists of Tirna Scithe Maze Solver - Technical Analysis

## 🎯 Overview
This project demonstrates a technical analysis and automated solver for the Mists of Tirna Scithe Maze game. It showcases DOM manipulation, pattern matching algorithms, and real-time game state analysis techniques.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **DOM State Extraction**: Reads current game state directly from HTML elements
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Matches image sequences against known question database
3. **Algorithmic Solving**: Determines correct answers through exact sequence matching
4. **Automated Interaction**: Demonstrates programmatic user interface interaction
5. **Timing Management**: Implements intelligent stopping mechanisms

## 📁 Files
- `script.js` - Main analysis and solving script

## 🛠️ Usage

### Educational Demonstration
1. Load the game in a browser
2. Open browser developer console
3. Copy and paste script contents for analysis
4. Observe automated pattern recognition

### Technical Analysis
```javascript
// Analyze current game state
getCurrentImages()

// Test pattern matching logic
findAnswer()

// Set custom username for score history
setUsername("YourName")

// Demonstrate algorithmic solving
manualClick(position)
```

### Research Tools
```javascript
// Pause analysis
stophack()

// Resume demonstration
starthack()

// Extract game data for study
getCurrentImages()
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Game Architecture Analysis
- **State Management**: HTML DOM-based game state storage
- **Question Database**: Structured array of image sequences and solutions
- **Timing System**: Real-time countdown with event-driven updates
- **User Interaction**: Click-based input with immediate feedback

### Algorithm Design
```javascript
function analyzeGameState(currentImages) {
    // Pattern matching against known sequences
    for each question in database:
        if exactSequenceMatch(question, currentImages):
            return solution
    return null
}
```

### Reliability Features
